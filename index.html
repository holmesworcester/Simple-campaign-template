Questions:
* the form is the biggest unfinished piece of this. Anything we can do to make it simple is extremely important! 
* Obviously there are some design limitations in keeping the markup this simple but I think it's worth it, to start at least. 
* which of these can we omit to simplify, without causing problems? 
* Can we omit URL, type?
* Will Facebook pull the title from the page title? If so, should we make adding a different og title optional and comment that one out? 
* Is there anything else we can do to simplify or accelerate filling in this section? 
* We should have a default sharing image for all FFTF campaigns, for sure.
* Folder should have a sketch file with a few nice editable sharing images.
* We could give people a couple options for default sharing images in a comment after that URL, e.g. /share1.png /share2.png  
* Also, some of these items could be commented out as optional. Note that the defaults can be roughly the maximum usable length such that anything that takes up the same lateral space is likely to work. 
* Note my idea of making the default sharing text something that is both a) generically usable c) just safely under the max width for the respective field, so that campaigners can use it as a guide for length, e.g. by copying it and writing something underneath it. 
* Include note for campaigners on the need to comment out quotation marks in the meta tags.
* Can we include alternate sharing text / images for freeprogress testing in this page itself, perhaps in a freeprogress-specific section below?
* If we could include multiple h1's and h2's but hide them with CSS, and include some javascript that bandit-algorithm (auto transition to winner) tests which one best drives submissions, that would be awesome. See the <h1> for a suggestion on markup.
